1. I have tested all the cases with the help of Postman. For reference, I have attached the dump (JSON) file for the Postman REST API testing requests.
   
2. For deploying this in a production environment, we can do the following:
     i. Unlike hosting on a local machine, we can host this on hosting providers like AWS, Google Cloud Platform,
        and many more so that we can have scalable databases.
    ii. We can use a CI/CD pipeline. It is used like we have a repository
        and after changes or when we deploy our development to production environment,
        we need CI/CD because it will help to automate our testing. CI/CD stands for continuous integration and continuous delivery.
        It's a software development process that combines automated code building and testing with deployment.
        example - Jenkins and Azure Piplelines
